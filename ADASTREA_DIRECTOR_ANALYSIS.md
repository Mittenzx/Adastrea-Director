   - Each phase builds on previous foundation
   - Realistic timelines and success criteria

2. **Production-Ready Quality (Phases 1-2)**
   - Comprehensive test coverage (161 tests, 100% passing)
   - Clean, modular codebase
   - Excellent documentation

3. **Strategic Unreal Engine Integration**
   - Remote Control API is the right approach
   - Recognizes UE-specific challenges
   - Plans for Blueprint support

4. **Cost-Conscious Design**
   - Uses efficient embeddings
   - Implements caching and batch processing
   - Considers local LLM alternatives

### Weaknesses & Concerns ⚠️

#### 1. OpenAI API Dependency

**Concern:** Entire system depends on external API with ongoing costs.

**Impact:**
- Monthly costs: $20-100+ depending on usage
- No offline mode
- Subject to API rate limits and availability
- Privacy concerns (code sent to OpenAI)

**Mitigation:** Plan for local LLM integration in Phase 3.

#### 2. Limited Blueprint Understanding

**Concern:** Blueprints are central to Adastrea, but Director has limited support.

**Impact:**
- Cannot analyze Blueprint complexity
- Cannot suggest Blueprint refactoring
- Plans may not account for Blueprint-specific challenges

**Mitigation:** Prioritize Blueprint parser development.

#### 3. Phase 3 Complexity Risk

**Concern:** Phase 3 is ambitious with many dependencies.

**Risks:**
- Unreal Remote Control API may have limitations
- Automated playtesting is complex and unreliable
- False positive rate could be too high
- Integration challenges with existing workflows

**Mitigation:** Conservative approach with pilot programs.

#### 4. Phase 4 Creative Quality

**Concern:** AI-generated creative content may not meet quality standards.

**Risks:**
- Generic or clichéd quest narratives
- Inconsistent lore and character voices
- Requires significant human editing (>50%)
- Team may reject AI-assisted creative work

**Mitigation:** Treat as "first draft" tool only with extensive human review.

#### 5. Knowledge Drift

**Concern:** Ingested documentation can become outdated.

**Impact:**
- Stale answers based on old documentation
- Suggestions that conflict with current architecture
- Confusion when code and docs diverge

**Mitigation:** Automated re-ingestion on doc changes with version tracking.

### Security & Privacy Considerations 🔒

#### 1. Code Exposure

**Risk:** Source code sent to OpenAI for analysis.

**Mitigation:**
- Use Azure OpenAI (enterprise agreement)
- Implement code sanitization
- Local LLM for sensitive code
- Team policy on what code to share

#### 2. Credential Security

**Risk:** API keys and GitHub tokens in plaintext.

**Mitigation:**
- Use secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- `.env` file with proper `.gitignore`
- Regular key rotation

#### 3. Remote Control API Security

**Risk:** Unreal Engine Remote Control opens attack surface.

**Mitigation:**
- Localhost-only binding
- Authentication tokens
- Whitelist of allowed commands
- Audit logging of all operations
